**Choclo** is a Python library that hosts optimized forward modelling and
kernel functions for running geophysical forward and inverse models, intended
to be used by other libraries as the underlying layer of their computation.

"Choclo" is a term used in some countries of South America to refer to corn,
originated from the `quechua
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechuan_languages>`__
word *chuqllu*.
