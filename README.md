## About

**Choclo** is a Python library that hosts optimized kernel functions for
running geophysical forward and inverse models, intended to be used by other
libraries as the underlying layer of their computation.
"Choclo" is a term used in some countries of South America to refer to corn,
originated from the [quechua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechuan_languages)
word _chuqllu_.

## Project goals

* Provide optimized kernel functions for gravity and magnetic forward and
  inverse models that can be easily harnessed by different geophysical
  libraries.
* Generate a pure-Python library that could be easily distributed and installed
  on any operating system.
* Rely on [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) for just-in-time compilations and
  optional parallelization.
* Keep the dependencies to the bare minimum to encourage other libraries to
  depend on Choclo.

## Project status

**Choclo is ready for use but still changing.**
This means that we sometimes break backwards compatibility as we try to
improve the software based on user experience, new ideas, better design
decisions, etc. Please keep that in mind before you update Choclo to a newer
version.

**We welcome feedback and ideas!** This is a great time to bring new ideas on
how we can improve the project.
